This Project was made as a requisite for the ICOM5015 course. The following is a description of this project.

 "Shortest Path Planning with Convex Polygonal Obstacles" delves into the intricate task of finding the shortest route between two points on a plane cluttered with convex polygonal obstacles. By analyzing state spaces, optimizing paths using straight-line segments, and implementing search algorithms, it addresses the challenges robots encounter in navigating crowded environments.

  "Missionaries and Cannibals Problem" tackles the timeless puzzle of transporting three missionaries and three cannibals across a river while adhering to strict constraints. By formulating precise problem definitions, implementing optimal solutions with search algorithms, and exploring the cognitive hurdles individuals face, it sheds light on the complexities lurking within seemingly simple scenarios, offering insights into AI problem-solving strategies.
