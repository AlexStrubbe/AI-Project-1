Performance Measurement in Vacuum Cleaner World
==========================================

Exercise 2.11:
-----------------------------------------
### Objective:
Implement a modular performance-measuring environment simulator for the vacuum-cleaner world to facilitate easy modification of sensors, actuators, and environment characteristics.

### Methodology:
1. **Simulation Environment Setup**:
   - Design a modular simulator for the vacuum-cleaner world.
   - Define parameters such as environment size, shape, dirt placement, etc.
   
2. **Agent Implementation**:
   - Implement an agent with sensors and actuators for navigating and cleaning the environment.
   
3. **Performance Measurement**:
   - Measure performance metrics such as time taken to clean the environment, number of actions performed, etc.
   
4. **Modularity Testing**:
   - Test the simulator's modularity by easily changing environment characteristics and agent behaviors.

Exercise 2.14:
-------------------------------------------------
### Objective:
Investigate the performance of different types of agents in a modified vacuum environment with unknown geography and initial dirt configuration.

### Methodology:
1. **Simple Reflex Agent Evaluation**:
   - Analyze if a simple reflex agent can be perfectly rational for the modified environment.
   
2. **Randomized Agent Function**:
   - Design a simple reflex agent with a randomized agent function and measure its performance compared to a deterministic simple reflex agent.
   
3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Evaluate the performance of both agents on various environments.
   
4. **Environment Design**:
   - Design environments where the randomized agent performs poorly to showcase its limitations.

5. **Reflex Agent with State**:
   - Implement a reflex agent with state and measure its performance against a simple reflex agent.
   
6. **Rational Agent Design**:
   - Explore the possibility of designing a rational agent based on the reflex agent with state.
